    Fast, rule-based validation of QE hyperparameter vectors.

    Parameters:
    - x_vec_params: The hyperparameter vector (np.ndarray).
    - hamiltonian: The Hamiltonian (e.g., FermionOperator or similar).

    Returns:
    - bool: True if the configuration passes static checks, else False.
    
    Example checks (to modify as needed):
    - Are values within reasonable bounds?
    - Is `cut_off` too small/large?
    - Is `number of shots` within the expected range?

    Deeper validation that may involve the execution of a single method
    but not the whole evaluation step
    (e.g., Hamiltonian size after reduction, number of circuit elements).

    Parameters:
    - x_vec_params: The hyperparameter vector (np.ndarray).
    - hamiltonian: The Hamiltonian.

    Returns:
    - bool: True if the configuration is valid under some simulation context.
